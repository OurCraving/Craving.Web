    <h1 class="md-headline">What is OurCraving? </h1>
    <p>
      <b>OurCraving</b> is a service provided by
      <b>CravingConnect</b>, which dedicated to help people find their cravings. </p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">Shouldn't it be "OurCraving
      <b>s</b>"?</h1>
    <p>You are definitely right. But that domain name was taken and we are lack of creativity.</p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">Why do I want to use this website?</h1>
    <p>Just like you, we love food. However, all the existing restaurant discovery services do not give us the confidence to walk in a place and know what we need to order to fulfill our cravings. Hence, we create this to satisfy our own cravings. If you
      want to help, use it and share what you love to order. </p>
    <h1 class="md-headline">Do I have to love food to use it?</h1>
    <p>Yes, and if you don't, we immediately assume you are an alien. </p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">What is so different?</h1>
    <p>We are unique in 2 ways:
      <ul>
        <li>We provide craving search only, no complex filtering. You see what you want to eat and what you can order. </li>
        <li>We provide a unique URL so your friends can share your proposal, or you can tweet your craving plan and your followers can help you decide.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">How can I trust those dish detail?</h1>
    <p>There is only one way to determine that, which is go to the restaurant and eat, and then come back here to tell us. </p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">What is craving proposal?</h1>
    <p>It's a to-eat list. You add all the dishes you want to eat to a proposal, which could be a lunch plan with coworkers. Next you send one single URL to all of your coworkers. They will each cast a vote. You folks can peacefully and efficintly conclude
      where to eat. Everyone is happy! </p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">Sounds good, how many people can vote?</h1>
    <p>As many as you wish. You could even tweet the URL. Let's say you are a food critic, and you pick 10 dishes, which are all the same one - Fish and Chip. You name the proposal to be "The Best Fish and Chip in Town". You share the link to all of your
      1 millions followers (we know you don't have that many, but we won't tell anyone). Let your followers to decide which one is actually the best. </p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
    <h1 class="md-headline">That is interesting, how many vote can each cast?</h1>
    <p>Only one, we are pretty democratic (ssh, we don't know what that means though)!</p>
    <md-divider></md-divider>
